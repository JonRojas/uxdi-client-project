WHAT ARE GA’S UX CLIENT PROJECTS?
General Assembly’s User Experience Design Immersive Program is a 10-week, full-time, graduate-level educational program that helps early to mid-career professionals break into the field of UX design.

Client projects are the final project of the UX Immersive Program and occur from Mon, May 4 - Thur, May 21. Teams of 3-5 UX designers, under the guidance of 2 seasoned mentors, dedicate 3 weeks and 120+ hours of research, strategy and design to help move your product forward. There is no cost for participating, just a desire to benefit from the UX process and an interest in meeting talented UX designers that might be a perfect fit for your growing team!

HERE’S WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM OUR DESIGNERS
Our UX designers will present you with a user-centered, research-based design strategy and accompanying deliverables that you can begin implementing right away.

Deliverables can include, but are not limited to: 
- User research (research plan, script, screener, consent, raw data, data evaluation).
- Domain research (competitive / comparative analysis, task analysis).
- Behavioral and attitudinal insights about your product.
- Representative user personas and scenarios.
- User flows, user stories, storyboards, journey mapping and user journeys.
- Concept maps.
- Content strategy insights.
- Features / functions / requirements list.
- Structural diagrams, sitemaps and navigation schemas.
- Sketches, wireframes and a 20-30 screen clickable prototype.
- User interface and interaction design.

HERE’S WHAT WE’LL NEED FROM YOU
3-5 hours/per week of availability from Mon, May 4 to Thur, May 21.

Clients must also:
- Attend a 2-hour kick-off meeting on Mon, May 4, from 1:30-3:30pm.
- Attend a 1-hour final presentation meeting on Thur, May 21. Time TBD.
- Be available by phone and email for team collaboration and weekly sign-offs (3-5 hours per week).
- Provide relevant analytics and metrics (qualitative and quantitative), as requested by team.

- Provide access to your site, product and/or feature currently in development.
- Be willing to host an office site visit for design team, if beneficial to the project.
- Consent to our UX designers publishing project deliverables on their online portfolios (we do not disclose proprietary or customer information, but NDAs will not be signed).

WHO WE'VE WORKED WITH IN THE PAST
Participating in client projects is a great fit for small to mid-size startups and tech companies with digital products ranging from e-commerce, SaaS, mobile, wearables and physical GUIs. Non-profits and mission-based organizations with a digital presence have benefitted greatly from our design work as well.
